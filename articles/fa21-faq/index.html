    </header>
     <h2 id="fall-2021-cs-61a----frequently-asked-questions">Fall 2021 CS 61A -- Frequently Asked Questions</h2>


<p>The Fall 2021 offering of CS 61A will be in person and on campus, but with
online lectures and some options for remote students. Here are answers to some
frequently asked questions.</p>

<p><strong>Do students need to be on campus to take the course?</strong></p>

<p>The 61A course experience is designed around on-campus students. If you have a
choice, come to campus. Our experience during the pandemic has been that
discussion sections, one-on-one help, small-group tutoring, peer-to-peer
support, and study groups are all quite difficult to replicate online. As a
result, students did not make as much progress through the course material
during fully remote semesters on average, nor did they form as many lasting
academic relationships with peers and course staff. If you really want to learn
the 61A content well and participate in the community of people learning
computer science at Berkeley, then your best option by far is to come to campus
(and actually come to class once you're on campus).</p>

<p>That said, it is possible to take the course remotely, and we will dedicate
signficant effort to supporting remote students. There will be two remote
sections each week (in addition to about 50 in-person sections) and some
one-on-one support will be available online to help with assignments. These will
be available to everyone. If you either can't come to campus (due to travel
restrictions) or have decided not to come to campus (for whatever reason), you
can still take CS 61A in Fall 2021.</p>

<p><strong>How will students take exams?</strong></p>

<p>The current plan is to hold paper-based exams on campus in designated exam
rooms. The exam schedule will be posted shortly, once campus confirms the
availability of rooms.</p>

<p>Remote study students who have completed a COVID-19 Exception Request Form in
eTang (see <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/requirements/covid19">UHS requirements</a> for
more information) may take exams remotely during the scheduled exam periods. To
be eligible for a remote exam, students will need to provide documentation
confirming that they are studying remotely and will not be on campus.</p>

<p>In the event that in-person exams are not possible due to campus closure or
occupancy restrictions, exams will be delivered remotely.</p>

<p>Unlike some courses, the particular subject matter of CS 61A makes it very
difficult to ensure a fair exam in which many students are taking the exam in
person and many are taking it remotely. Since it is not likely that all
on-campus students will have a suitable space to take a remote exam
simultaneously, an in-person exam is the best available option.</p>

<p><strong>Will all students be admitted from the waitlist?</strong></p>

<p>The instructors are keen to enroll all students who are interested in taking it
this semester, but we can't guarantee that everyone will be admitted. If you're
on the waitlist when instruction begins and you hope to take the course, you
should begin to participate as if you were already enrolled. Choose a section.
Come to class. Turn in assignments on time. There are no extensions available
for students who join the course late, but nothing will prevent you from
participating at the start of the semester.</p>

<p><strong>Are there enrollment codes?</strong></p>

<p>No. The waitlist is processed in order. There's no way to be prioritized for enrollment.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to take another course with the same final exam time as CS 61A?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. The final exam is scheduled for Thursday ... Documentation will be required in order to be approved for an alternate exam time. We don't collect that information until after the add/drop deadline has passed, since many students adjust their schedules and conflicts often disappear as a result.</p>

<p><strong>Is CS 61A the right course for someone with no prior programming experience?</strong></p>

<p>For most students, no. Taking CS 61A with no prior programming experience tends
to be extraordinarily time-consuming and challenging. It's a fast-pace and dense
course in which even experienced programmers tend to learn a lot. Absorbing all
of the course material in one semester if none of it is familiar is quite
difficult indeed. Some students have succeeded in the past, so it is possible to
take CS 61A without prior programming experience, but most students who have
never programmed before would be better served by taking CS 10 first. Taking
Data 8 first is also a reasonable option, but past students have reported that
CS 10 is better preparation than Data 8 (which is no surprise, since CS 10
shares many topics with CS 61A while Data 8 is largely a statistics course).</p>

<p>Students who have taken a high-school computer science course, an online course,
or who otherwise have prior experience programming should be in a good starting
position to take CS 61A. The course can still be a lot of work, even with prior
experience, but that's because lots of practice is necessary to learn how to
program.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to skip CS 61A?</strong></p>
